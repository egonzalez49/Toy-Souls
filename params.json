You’ve spent much of Blake’s life providing joy, comfort, and support.  Life is idyllic, and you cannot imagine a world without Blake.  One Fall day, Blake’s parents brought home Billy, a flashy new toy.  You hope you and Billy can become friends.  Little did you know... \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Story Summary\r\nThe player is a child's toy (likely a teddy bear, depending on asset availability) whose owner has bought a new, secretly malicious toy (the antagonist) which perniciously plagues the minds of your owner and other toys. The antagonist, along with its possessed minions, continuously chases the player. The player will acquire skills and better gear throughout the adventure, culminating in a final showdown with this evil toy.  However, the player will decide when it is time to eventually engage in combat, depending on how strong (or impatient) the player feels.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Releases\r\nMost recent release can be found:\r\n\r\n[Releases](https://github.gatech.edu/sliang76/Toys-Souls/releases)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
